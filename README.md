# zatar-lwm2m-client-example
Example projects using LWM2M/CoAP/TLS to connect to the Zatar IoT Platform

## Clone
To retrieve the code discussed here, clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:zatar-iot/zatar-lwm2m-client-example.git
```

There are two subprojects, ```zatar-hello-world```, which does nothing other than connect to Zatar and bring a device online, and ```zatar-echo-example```, which has an example of writable and executable resources.

We recommend using ```zatar-hello-world``` first, just to connect your device to Zatar and ensure that your device token works. ```zatar-echo-example``` is then a larger example, showing all of the features that Zatar takes advantage of.

## Import
You can import both projects into Eclipse or IntelliJ by importing the root project (```zatar-lwm2m-client-example```).
